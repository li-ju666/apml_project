Code implementation for the Advanced Probabilistic Machine Learning course project can be found in the python notebook "APML-project.ipynb". 

CONTENT. Namely, it covers the following parts (in the order of their appearance in the notebook):
    Q.5: Gibbs sampling histograms and fitted pdf curves, burn-in period and sample size analysis;
    Q.6: posterior skills update with match result obervations via Gibbs sampling (SerieA);
    Q.7: accuracy within the one-step-ahead prediction procedure for match results (SerieA);
    Q.9: message-passing vs. Gibbs sampling for approximation of posterior skills;
    Q.10: accuracy within the one-step-ahead prediction procedure for match results (our data, NBA 2021/22);
    Q.11: convergence for tuning variance of a match result, i.e., variance of t (serieA).

INPUT. To work with SerieA data, one should have the file "SerieA.csv" in the same directory as ipynb file (Q.6, 7, 11). To allow you to work with our own dataset (NBA matches of season 2021/2022) we attach the file "nba-2021-UTC.csv".

OUTPUT. Notebook outputs some of its results as textfiles and images. But every needed output is also shown in the corresponding cell.
